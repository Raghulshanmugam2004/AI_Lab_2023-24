### REGISTER NUMBER :  212222040128
### AIM: 
To  write  a logic program  to solve Towers of Hanoi problem  using SWI-PROLOG. 
### Algorithm:
1. Start the program
2. Write a rules for finding solution of Towers of Hanoi in SWI-PROLOG.
3. If only one disk  => Move disk from X to Y.
4. If Number of disk greater than 0 then
5. Move  N-1 disks from X to Z.
6. Move  Nth disk from X to Y
7. Move  N-1 disks from Y to X.
8. Run the program  to find answer of  query.

### Program:
```
move(1,X,Y,_) :-
write('Move top disk from '),
write(X),
write(' to '),
write(Y),
nl.
move(N,X,Y,Z) :-
N>1,
M is N-1,
move(M,X,Z,Y),
move(1,X,Y,_),
move(M,Z,Y,X).
```
### Output:

### Result:
Thus the solution of Towers of Hanoi problem was found by logic programming.
